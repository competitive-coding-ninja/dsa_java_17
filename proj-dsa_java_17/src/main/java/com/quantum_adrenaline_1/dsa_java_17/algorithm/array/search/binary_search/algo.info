ANSWER:
======

The optimizedBinarySearch() algorithm is different from the conventional binary search algorithm in one key way: it checks the first and last elements of the array before checking the middle element. This can save a few comparisons in the best case, when the search key is at the beginning or end of the array.

Here is a table (in CSV format) comparing the two algorithms:

Algorithm,Checks first and last elements,Time complexity
Conventional binary search,No,O(log n)
Optimized binary search,Yes,O(log n)

As you can see, the optimized binary search algorithm has the same time complexity as the conventional binary search algorithm in the worst case. However, it has the potential to be more efficient in the best case.

Here is an example of how the optimized binary search algorithm can save a few comparisons in the best case:

Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Search key: 1

Conventional binary search:
1. Compare search key to middle element (5): search key is less than middle element.
2. Compare search key to first element (1): search key is equal to first element.
3. Search key found at index 0.

Optimized binary search:
1. Compare search key to first element (1): search key is equal to first element.
2. Search key found at index 0.
In this example, the optimized binary search algorithm only needs to perform one comparison, while the conventional binary search algorithm needs to perform two comparisons.

Overall, the optimized binary search algorithm is a good choice if you are looking for a binary search algorithm that is both efficient and simple to implement.

Here are some merits of the optimized binary search algorithm over the conventional binary search algorithm:

It has the potential to be more efficient in the best case.
It is simple to implement and understand.
